# NJIT-IT-202-Assignment-3-Weather-app
We are creating a weather app using openweathermap api.
First step is to create an account on https://openweathermap.org/.
Then get your API key.
We need need the api key to generate  the url.
The url will give us the JSAON object.
Add awesome JSON chrome extension, that will make the Json object redable.
We will create two kind of weather app, one will use the valid US zipcode and other will use your current location.
